insert into customer values(100, 2, '12/01/2023');

insert into customer values(101, 3, '12/01/2023');

Find Count of New and old customers 

WITH CTE AS (
SELECT order_date as orderdate,custid,LAG(order_date) OVER (PARTITION BY custid ORDER BY order_date) as Prev_order_date
FROM customers
)
SELECT orderdate,COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN prev_order_date IS NULL THEN custid END) AS New_customer,
COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN prev_order_date IS NOT NULL THEN Custid END) AS old_customer
FROM CTE
GROUP BY orderdate


Output:

orderdate	    new_customer	old_customer
2023-01-12	     3	              0
2023-01-13	     2	              1
2023-01-14	     1	              2
