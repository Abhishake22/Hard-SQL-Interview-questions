Scenario: Removing Duplicate Product Records

Situation: You are a database administrator for an online retail company, and you've discovered that there are duplicate product records in the "Products" table. Each product is identified by a unique ProductID, but some products have been mistakenly entered multiple times with the same ProductID. Your task is to remove the duplicate product records from the table.

Table: Products

ProductID	ProductName	Category	Price
1	Smartphone	Electronics	500
2	Laptop	Electronics	1000
3	Headphones	Electronics	50
4	Smartwatch	Electronics	200
5	Tablet	Electronics	300
6	Laptop	Electronics	1000
7	Headphones	Electronics	50


Question 1: Write an SQL query to identify the duplicate product records based on the ProductName and Category.

SELECT ProductName,category,COUNT(*) AS Number_of_duplicated_records
FROM products
GROUP BY productname,category
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1

Question 2: Write an SQL query to remove the duplicate product records, keeping only one occurrence of each product with the same ProductName and Category.


DELETE FROM products
WHERE productID IN (
SELECT MAX(ProductID)
FROM products
GROUP BY ProductName,Category
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1)
